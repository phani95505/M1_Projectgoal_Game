Introduction


The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3*3 grid lines; The game is played by two players or by player and computer using AI, who take turns. The first player moves with a circle, the second with a cross. The player who draws a horizontal, vertical or diagonal order of three marks wins. In my  program I should draw a game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark, change players after each successful move, and announce the winner.
